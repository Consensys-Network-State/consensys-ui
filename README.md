# Consensys UI

> üöß **Note**: CUI is currently under active development. While we're working hard to make it production-ready, please be aware that APIs and features may change. We welcome your feedback and contributions as we continue to improve!

CUI is a comprehensive design system that enables truly universal application development:

- üåê **Cross-Platform** - Build once and run everywhere with a unified codebase
- üîÑ **Universal Compatibility** - Works fully on web, fully on native, and in hybrid environments
- üñºÔ∏è **SVG Icon Support** - Use any SVG icon library seamlessly across platforms
- üé® **Advanced Theming** - Powerful, customizable theming with dark/light mode and color schemes
- ‚ôø **Fully Accessible** - Built with accessibility in mind, including ARIA roles and proper semantics
- ‚õìÔ∏è **Web3 Integration** - First-class support for blockchain and Web3 applications
- üõ†Ô∏è **Customizable** - Easily adaptable to your brand with configurable styles and components
- üß© **Multi-Framework** - Works with React and React Native, with consistent APIs across platforms

#### Package Architecture

The packages follow a layered architecture:
1. **theme** ‚Üí Theming system and design tokens
2. **config** ‚Üí Build configuration layer (depends on theme)
3. **ui** ‚Üí UI components (depends on theme)
4. **web3** ‚Üí Blockchain components (depends on ui)

### Example Applications

- **[vite-example](apps/vite-example)** - Example Vite.js implementation
- **[expo-example](apps/expo-example)** - Example React Native/Expo implementation
- **[docs](apps/docs)** - Documentation site

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Package Development

Build all packages:
```bash
pnpm build:deps
```

Watch all packages for development:
```bash
pnpm watch:deps
```

Build individual packages:
```bash
pnpm core:build
pnpm ui:build
pnpm web3:build
```

### Running Examples

Start Vite example:
```bash
pnpm vite:dev
```

Build Vite example:
```bash
pnpm vite:build
```

Preview built Vite example:
```bash
pnpm vite:preview
```

Start Expo example:
```bash
pnpm expo:start
```

Start documentation site:
```bash
pnpm docs:start
```

### Maintenance

Clean up node_modules and dist folders:
```bash
pnpm clean
```

### Versioning and Publishing

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning and publishing our packages. This ensures consistent versioning across our monorepo and maintains a detailed changelog.

To create a new changeset:
```bash
pnpm changeset
```

To update versions based on changesets:
```bash
pnpm changeset version
```

To build and publish packages:
```bash
pnpm changeset publish
```

The typical workflow is:
1. Make your changes
2. Create a changeset (`pnpm changeset`)
3. Update versions (`pnpm changeset version`)
4. Commit the changes (version bumps and changelog updates)
5. Build and publish (`pnpm changeset publish`)
